# gender_prediction
Petri Peter and
Szakal Gergely Finance Master students at
Corvinus University of Budapest on 
9-12-2021 set up a
model on predicting the gender of 3,617,465 social media profiles. Our prediciton is based on the hipothesis of homophilia.
We measured the avarage number of relationships with males of both men and women. It turned out males has a little more relationships with males then females. We calculated the arithmetic mean of the above mentioned avarages, call it 'cut value'. All profiles with more relationships with males then the cut value has been predicted females. Others has been predicted males.
We did not use profiles with less then five relationships because we considered these relationships accidental.
